# jarvisstartup-macos

The information and tutorial regarding this repository will be available on my blog at "omeedtehrani.com". This repository simply displays the files that I have on my Computer that help me turn my MacOS startup (post-login) into a Jarvis startup sequence. These scripts, used with the Automator app, can do some pretty cool stuff!
